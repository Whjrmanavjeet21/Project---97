        <h3 style="font-family: Gill Sans;color: crimson;">Society 5.0 Balances Economic Development and Solves Social Issues</h3>
        As the economy grows, life is becoming prosperous and convenient, the demand for energy and foodstuffs is increasing, lifespan is becoming longer, and the aging society is advancing. In addition, the globalization of the economy is progressing, international competition is becoming increasingly severe, and problems such as the concentration of wealth and regional inequality are growing. Social problems that must be solved in opposition (as a tradeoff) to such economic development have become increasingly complex. Here, a variety of measures have become necessary such as the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, increased production and reduced loss of foodstuffs, mitigation of costs associated with the aging society, support of sustainable industrialization, redistribution of wealth, and correction of regional inequality, but achieving both economic development and solutions to social problems at the same time has proven to be difficult in the present social system.

        <h3 style="font-family: Gill Sans;color: crimson;">Economic Development and Solutions to Social Problems in Society 5.0</h3>
        In Society 5.0, new value created through innovation will eliminate regional, age, gender, and language gaps and enable the provision of products and services finely tailored to diverse individual needs and latent needs. In this way, it will be possible to achieve a society that can both promote economic development and find solutions to social problems.Achieving such a society, however, will not be without its difficulties, and Japan intends to face them head-on with the aim of being the first in the world as a country facing challenging issues to present a model future society.

        <h3 style="font-family: Gill Sans;color: crimson;">The Evolution: Society 5.0</h3>
        Overflowing of information to store, identifying the relevant and real data to analyze, and restricted scope of action due to physical ability and lack of law and policies, creating a strain on current industrial, economic and social infrastructure of the nations , preventing them from taking adequate measures to resolve any critical issues in time. Increasing globalization and lifespan, progressing economies, international competitions, social and regional inequalities, are further complexing the situation. Sustainability across the industries, Green Energy, Climate Control, and Social Innovation are the need of the hour. The tremendous potential of the Industry 4.0 Revolution is paving the way for the nations to embrace Society 5.0, the future reality as a stepping-stone to a prosperous data-synchronized Super Smart human-centered society. Social Innovation is combining new technologies such as IoT, AI, Robotics, Big data with Advanced Analytics capable of achieving a forward-looking prosperous society that balances economic advancement with the resolution of social problems. People, things, and systems are all connected in initiating the evolution of Society 5.0, converging cyberspace, and physical space by collecting big data from various sources through sensors and devices.
